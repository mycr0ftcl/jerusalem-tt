## AGRICULTURAL TOURS

## In the land of Olives and Figs

To know that Miracles do come true is to see the plants growing in the desert in Israel.

From green houses to organic farms, irrigation technology to urban farming. Dairy farms and fisheries. We're on hand to show it all to you.

## THE STARTUP NATION HAS DONE IT ALL

High tech and low tech has transformed the land to lush green. You name the vegetable or the fruit and you'll most likely find it grown in Israel. How is this possible in a country with the smallest annual rain quantities? How is it even possible in the desert where it almost never rains? And how is Israel able to satisfy internal demand and even export much of its produce?

Allow us to take you and your clients on the journey and show you how.

## WHAT SHALL WE SHOW YOU?

The range of produce generated by Israeli farms is widespread. The technologies used by Israeli farmers also are varied and depend on the part of the country the farm is based at and the type of produce that grows on the farm. Since the beginning, the target was clear and simple. Maximize production while using the minimum amount of water possible and farm all the corners of the country, desert included. Our Agricultural tours will show you the following and much more:

- Fruit plantations of all kinds - bananas, cherries, grapes, Litchi, pomegranate...
- Cow sheds, dairy farms, fisheries and aquaculture...
- Greenhouse solutions, irrigation technology, and agriculture research centers
- Plant water and nutrition management
- Industrial fruit and vegetable production including packing and distribution solutions (turnkey solutions)
- Organic farming
- Urban farming
- Agricultural research for the cultivation in extreme desert conditions

And don't forget that we'll show you what Kibbutz life is all about. We'll take you to a number of Kibbutz's and we'll show you how people live and work on the Kibbutz, tell you all about the history of life there and how it is an ever evolving process.
