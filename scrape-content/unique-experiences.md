## UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

## Where the fun is extraordinary.

## EACH CITY IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

Do you want to experience the extraordinary?

Just ask for it.

We will introduce you to each town's and city's story, to every tiny dust atom of the novel. And we guarantee you will love to be in Israel, Jordan and Palestine again.

The tasty food from the hand of the DRUZE in the north, the cooking experience with the Palestinian families in the northern east, the architecture and art stories that won't be found except in the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem!

- FALAFEL IS FOREVER UNIQUE — ©JERUSALEM T&T
- THE ART AND ARCHITECTURE IN THE STORY OF THE WALLED OFF HOTEL

And it's not all about the daytime, but also the night life. The night parties at the party capital Tel Aviv, and the walk at night in Ramallah. Or ever thought about camping in the middle of the desert, with the local Bedouins? or lay down in a tent to start watching the amazing painting of the stars?

Don't forget the tanning under the lovely sun and swimming in the pure Turquoise water of the Mediterranean Sea. The floating in the Dead Sea and the diving in the Red Sea.
