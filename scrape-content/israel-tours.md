## A COMBINATION OF ANTIQUES AND HIGH TECH!

A startup young nation, yes, but its foundations are built on history...

We encourage you to discover the two sides of each city, the religious history and architecture in the old city of Jerusalem and the modern city center of Tel Aviv... The ancient Jaffa and its modern beaches....

We want to tell you the story of Acre walls' resistance, the gorgeous Baha'i Gardens - Haifa, and the churches in Nazareth..

The religion spirit in Tiberias and in River Jordan.

Many many more to discover!

A small country, but a wide range of different attractions where you never get tired of discovering more and more.....

Tel Aviv, Yaffa, Acre, Haifa, Caesarea and more on the west side of Israel, and Tiberias, River Jordan and the Dead Sea on the east side of Israel..... Each city of them is a novel itself with its history and ruins, with its people and food, with its water and beaches.

Dive in the waters or float over it...... Israel offers it all and more.

Not only the buildings and their architecture, the beaches with sweet and salty waters talk about Israel, the wildlife also does.... Get the chance to see, watch and enjoy the variety of animal species Israel has... The colorful, the cute, the small and the huge, on ground, flying up in the air, and inside the water, all are living in their homeland Israel peacefully and well-taken care of.
