## THE UNUSUAL FUN — WET AND DRY!

## THE SALT & SUGAR COUNTRY

In the middle of the country, in its capital city Amman, you will experience the middle eastern part of the world, the history, the culture, the food, the people, the adventures, and and and......

Where the MANSAF (a main dish made of lamb meet cooked in yogurt, and rice) and KNAFEH (a sweets dish made of white cheese put in between two layers of dough, toasted and served with sugar syrup) are famous, you won't leave Jordan without addicting its salt and sugar.

Experience the like-home feeling and hospitality of the Jordanians and the Bedouins... In the Bedouin campsites, in the middle of the red desert, between the rocks.

And the ancient cities of Petra and Jerash are completely a different story.... One of the Seven Wonders of the World is here!!

Swim in the sand! Or swim in the lovely sea of Aqaba.. or even among the locals in the city center!

Get to hear the story from the rocks and stones.

Or let the bedtime story get you asleep — camping under the stars in Wadi Rum with the Bedouins.
