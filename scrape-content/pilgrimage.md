## A LAND THAT IS HOLY!!!

What is there that has not been said about this land - Holy to all monotheistic religions. We invite you to come and see with your own eyes and experience and feel with every tiny part of your heart and soul. We challenge you not to sense the indescribable feeling of the strong "maybe" that you are actually stepping on that very same spot that Jesus Christ has stepped on. We ourselves, the locals, live on this land and we cannot shake this feeling day in and day out.

No matter what your denomination, no matter what your belief, we'll take it upon ourselves to have you live the bible and walk in HIS footsteps. We'll make sure that upon your return home, when you are sitting down and reading the bible, you will have a very clear three dimensional image right there in front of you. We'll make sure the bible comes alive right in front of your eyes.

We know that such a Holy Pilgrimage is a visit and a tour of a lifetime. We know the significance and impact it had on many of our guests and pilgrims in the past. Lest us instill this experience in you. Allow us to make this very important travel occasion one that will forever be pleasantly engrained in your mind, heart and soul.
