We invite you to find this chest with us. Find out the mystery of the land of lowest natural point on Earth, and the salty water that carries you on the surface of the Dead Sea. Discover the identity of Palestine - the Olive Trees, and its colorful spring full of irises, jonquils and wild poppies.

We invite you to discover the spectacular mosaic floor at Hisham Palace - Jericho, the hand crafts and glass art work in Hebron... Visit the capital of sweets - Nablus, and live the night life of Ramallah... The birthplace of Jesus Christ - The Church of Nativity in Bethlehem, and the refugee camp life in Jenin.

That's NOT all, the mountains and valleys, meadows and rivers, deserts and lakes, and all the fantastic geography Palestine has is waiting for you!!
