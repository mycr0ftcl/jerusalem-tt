## A WIDE MIX OF CULTURES

Nowhere in the world will you experience a wider and more varied mix of cultures than in Israel, in Jordan and in Palestine. This is the special kind of Middle East where peoples from all over the world flocked and made this small corner their home. And what a home they made out of it.

Nowhere in the world has adapted to a plethora of cultures as has Israel. And nowhere in the world has richness in history and culture as do Jordan and Palestine. Combine the three together and you'll always come out on top. This is an intricate mix of cultures and a simplified sophistication at the same time.

From the beaches of the Mediterranean to the dry deserts, from the mountains in the north to the Red Sea in the south. With each step you take and each direction you follow you'll see, feel and absorb the multitudes of cultures and the amazing history that soak the daily lives of the people who call Israel, Jordan and Palestine home. You will be amazed with the beautiful harmony that brings all together and you'll indulge in the daily lives, visit the houses and see the architecture, taste the ever so evolving food and the food that has remained the same and will remain the same for generations to come.

We'll show you the smiles. We'll show you the ancient stones. We'll make the desert sands talk to you. We'll make the architecture of the buildings shape your visit. And after all is said and done, you'll know what it means to be an Israeli, a Jordanian and a Palestinian.
