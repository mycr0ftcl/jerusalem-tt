## A BITE OF OUR CORNER

- A mouth watering grape leaf local delicacy.
- A hummus and brown beans and Falafel street restaurant
- A sweeter than sweet dish of Knafeh
- A majestic Jordanian Mansaf
- A tasty Moroccan shakshouka
- A post modern Israeli restaurant run by world renowned chefs

And the list goes on and on - and while eating, visit the sites and the people and get to know them intimately.

As intimate as eating their food can get you.
